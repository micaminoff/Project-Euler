# Project-Euler
A remote haven for my attempts at learning maths and algorithms

This repo is primarily for my own use so I can work on these problems wherever I am.
My solutions are often slow and imperfect but hey, that's why I work on these problems.

If these solutions help you, more power to you! I'm also very happy for any critique :)
